some challenges when answering requests for information from higher
headquarters and outside entities. </p>

<p>The primary audience for this document is the staff, but
others may also find it useful. This is not intended to be a comprehensive
compilation of all activities or to provide a step-by-step detailed description
of how work is accomplished. Rather, its purpose is to provide a
basic familiarity with structures and concepts useful for understanding how we
operate.</p>

<p>In the recognition that there is often a time lag for new
employees to obtain access to computer resources this document is provided in
both hard copy and electronic format. The electronic format does however
provide links to other resources that are not possible to reproduce for the
hard copy.</p>
